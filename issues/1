## Description
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs type checking, tests, build, and optionally evaluation on every commit.

## Context
To maintain code quality and catch regressions early, we need a CI pipeline that:
- Runs TypeScript type checking
- Runs Vitest test suite
- Builds the project
- Optionally runs evaluation (configurable)
- Blocks PR merges on failures

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow file
- [ ] Add checkout step
- [ ] Add setup Node.js step
- [ ] Add pnpm setup step
- [ ] Add install dependencies step
- [ ] Add typecheck step: `pnpm typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Add test step: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Add build step: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Add evaluation step (optional, only on main branch): `pnpm eval`
- [ ] Configure to run on: push (main), pull_request
- [ ] Add status checks (required for PR merge)
- [ ] Document why eval is optional in PR context

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and is valid YAML
- Runs on: push to main, all pull requests
- Steps in order: checkout, setup node, setup pnpm, install, typecheck, test, build, eval (main only)
- All steps have appropriate error handling
- Workflow succeeds on clean commit without errors
- Workflow fails appropriately on TypeScript errors or test failures
- Evaluation runs only on main branch (not on every PR) to avoid delays
- Documentation in workflow comments explains the design decision

## Example Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm typecheck
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm build
      - name: Run evaluation (main only)
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: pnpm eval
```

## Notes
- This is part of Milestone 4
- Evaluation step is optional in PRs to keep CI fast
- Evaluation results on main can be tracked for regression detection
- Consider adding evaluation report artifact upload for future analysis
